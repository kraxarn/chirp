# chirp

A chirp is a small sound from a small bird, but also (soon) a small game engine for small games. Inspired by frameworks
like [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net) and [LÃ¶ve](https://love2d.org), built on top
of [raylib](https://www.raylib.com). *chirp!*

Supported platforms include Linux, macOS, Windows, Android and Web.

The engine source code is contained within the src/ directory, while a basic editor for creating levels, packing assets
etc., is contained within the editor/ directory.
