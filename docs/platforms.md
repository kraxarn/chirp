Platform support is divided up into three tiers, in no particular order within each tier:

*(Please note that binaries aren't provided for any platform until v1.0)*

## tier 1

Targets that are actively being tested and, more or less, guaranteed to work.

| target          | notes                  |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Android         | Only arm64-v8a         |
| Linux / SteamOS | Only amd64             |
| macOS           | Only arm64             |
| Windows         | Only x64, requires gcc |

## tier 2

Targets that are built against, and provided binaries for, but not actively being tested.

*(currently empty)*

## tier 3

Targets that are not being actively tested against, and there's no guarantee that it works, but it should, and if it
doesn't, it's a bug.

*(currently empty)*

## unsupported

These platforms have currently no support, but there are plans to support them in the future.
